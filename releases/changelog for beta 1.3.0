dev note: 
-beta trailers will be realised when the beta is smooth prob around 1..5.0, so when we advertise it, would be stable.
- it is recommended to create a new world so fewer bugs happen, but you can use an old world, just not too old.
- i have 2 updates for the future no cubes for april fools. and pollution of the relms for earth day
- eternal tales adds a story to the game i am gonna try to intagrate it with the modpack that will be in 1.2.0
- i don't want this pack to be all about exploring the main thing is that i will try to add small things like create nuclear wepaons and reactions and etc.

note: 
-I decided i will post the full mod list when release happens so everything is set in place.
- github reporsitory link is here and you can see updates in the work by reading the changelogs.
