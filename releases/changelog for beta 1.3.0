Change log 1.3.0 notes.

Make sure to create a backup of your world before updating.


Added:
- tectonic 
- minor quality of life mods
- some magic and structure mods
- fancy menu



Updated mods:
- tons of mods have been updated
- structures and dungeons have been overhauled and fixed.
- Wilderness API, the mod that I am working on, I have put the crawl-on-demand features in it. And some lazy dfu and memory fixes into it.



Changes:
- some performance and crash fixes
- I also changed winter to be not that cold in the start and end in the middle, though it will be bad. The same goes for summer.
- changed for ad astra for no temperature damage. hopefully, that works.
- other changes I made but did not document them.

Removed:
- crawl on demand 
- starter kit
- remove reloading screen.


Known issues:
-the terrain is a little messy. It will be adjusted and fixed throughout the beta.
- buildings and blocks out of place. It will be fixed during beta.
- error f_91074 is known 
- fps issues

Dev note: 
-Beta trailers will be released when the beta is smooth, probably around 1..5.0, so when we advertise it, it will be stable.
-It is recommended that you create a new world so fewer bugs happen, but you can use an old world, just not too old.
- I have two updates for the future: no cubes for April Fools. and pollution of the realms for Earth Day
- I don't want this pack to be all about exploring. The main thing is that. There will be RPG things, dungeons, and many other things to do. As development goes on, you will see more localized things.

Note: 
have fun that's all i have to say for now
