Known issues:
-the terrain is a little messy. It will be adjusted and fixed throughout the beta.
- buildings and blocks out of place. It will be fixed during beta.
- error f_91074 is known 
- fps issues

Dev note: 
-Beta trailers will be released when the beta is smooth, probably around 1..5.0, so when we advertise it, it will be stable.
-It is recommended that you create a new world so fewer bugs happen, but you can use an old world, just not one that is too old.
- I have two updates for the future: no cubes for April Fools. And pollution of the realms for Earth Day
- I don't want this pack to be all about exploring. The main thing is that. There will be RPG things, dungeons, and many other things to do. As development goes on, you will see more localized things.

Note: 
Have fun that's all I have to say for now
